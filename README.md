About this recipe
This delicious palak paneer recipe is the way my mom has always made it for our family. She has been making this recipe for years, has passed it onto me and now I am so happy to share it here.

It is one of the most popular and well-liked paneer recipes on the blog as well as our favorite at home.

In my palak paneer recipe, I show the method of blanching spinach. This is done so that the dish has a nice green color and it is a healthy practice as well.

I always recommend blanching spinach before making any dish where the spinach leaves are used in large quantities and where a puree is made from them. Blanching has many benefits and you can read more about them in this post of Palak Recipes.

This delicious palak paneer goes well with roti, naan, paratha or tandoori roti. Or serve it with jeera or biryani rice, saffron or ghee rice.

Palak Paneer vs Saag Paneer
Saag paneer and palak paneer are often considered the same dish, but they are not. Palak paneer is the authentic Indian dish made with only spinach puree, where saag paneer is made with a mixture of various greens.




Saag paneer seems to have been popularized outside of India, however it is still very uncommon in India.

In the Punjabi or Hindi language the word ‘saag’ means greens. Various leafy greens fall under this category of ‘saag’, such as amaranth leaves, spinach, dill leaves, radish leaves, mustard leaves, fenugreek leaves and purslane.

My mother-in-law never makes saag paneer, however there are four variations of palak or spinach saag that she makes.

One is made with mung lentils (palak mung dal), another with split chickpeas (chana dal palak), the third with potatoes (aloo palak) and the fourth with paneer – popularly known as palak paneer.

Technically saag paneer is a dish where the saag is made first by combining 2 to 3 types of greens. Then paneer is added to the pureed greens.

Even though they are different dishes, both palak paneer and saag paneer are healthy as well as delicious.

Step-by-Step Guide
How to make Palak Paneer
Blanching the Spinach

1. Using a colander or strainer, rinse the palak or spinach leaves (250 grams or 0.55 pounds), very well in running water.

rinsed palak or spinach



2. Boil 3 cups water in a pan, microwave or electric heater. Add ¼ tsp salt to the hot water and stir. Then add the spinach leaves to the hot water. Let the spinach leaves sit in the water for about 1 minute. If doing this on a stove-top, be sure to remove the pan from the hot burner.

3. After 1 minute, strain the spinach leaves.

4. Immediately add the palak or spinach leaves in a pan or bowl containing ice cold water. This method helps in preserving the green color of the spinach. Just add 8 to 10 ice cubes to 3 cups water to get cold water. Allow the spinach leaves to be in the cold water for a minute.

immersing the spinach leaves in cold water
5. Then drain the ice cold water. Add the spinach in a blender or grinder jar with 1 inch chopped ginger, (1 or 2 small to medium) garlic cloves and 1 or 2 chili peppers (green chillies). You can also use a hand-held immersion blender to make the puree.

6. Make a smooth spinach puree. No need to add water while making the puree. Set the spinach puree aside.

7. Heat 2 tablespoons oil (or ghee or butter) in a pan or kadai (wok). Here I have used butter. If using butter, melt it on a low flame making sure that it does not brown.

8. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and let them splutter.



cumin seeds added
9. Then add one small to medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf).

10. Add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions (1 small to medium sized onion).

finely chopped onions added


11. Sauté until the onions become golden.

12. Then add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic. Sauté till the raw aroma of garlic goes away. No need to brown the garlic.

13. Add ⅓ cup chopped tomatoes (1 small or medium sized tomato).

chopped tomatoes added
14. Stir and sauté the tomatoes until they soften.

15. Once the tomatoes are softened and you see fat releasing from the sides of the mixture, then add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon red chili powder (or cayenne pepper or paprika) and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). You can find asafoetida at your local spice store or on amazon, but if you don’t have it, you can skip it.

adding ground spice powders
16. Mix very well.

20. Simmer the gravy for 6 to 7 minutes or more until the palak (spinach) is cooked. Season with salt. The gravy or sauce will have also thickened by now.

21. Stir and add ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.

22. Stir again and then add the paneer cubes (200 to 250 grams cottage cheese). I have added the paneer cubes directly to the gravy. But you can also lightly pan-fry the paneer cubes in some oil until they are lightly browned and then add them to the palak gravy. In this case, you don’t need to cook the paneer further.

paneer cubes added
23. Mix very well and switch off the heat.

24. Lastly add 2 tablespoons low-fat cream. I used Amul brand cream. If using heavy whipping cream, then add 1 tablespoon of it. You can also add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) at this step, however this is optional.

cream added to palak paneer
25. Stir gently again so that the cream gets incorporated in the gravy uniformly.

26. Serve palak paneer hot with some roti, naan or paratha or cumin rice or ghee rice. You can top it with some butter or cream also while serving. Drizzle a few drops of lime or lemon juice on top along with ginger julienne.

Tips
Tips & Variations
Spinach: Use fresh tender spinach leaves. Remove the stems from the leaves if they are dense or stringy. Tender stems can be added. You can also use frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach.
Blanching: I would recommend blanching spinach in this recipe. Blanching removes the raw taste, bitterness and metallic flavor of spinach thereby making it palatable without having any after taste. It also gets rid of harmful microorganisms and pesticide residues. It also helps to preserve the green color of the spinach leaves.
Paneer: The paneer cubes can also be lightly pan-fried and then added to the spinach sauce. For packaged paneer or frozen paneer follow the instructions written on the pack. If possible try to use fresh paneer or better to use Homemade Paneer. 
Special Ingredients: Kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) and asafoetida (hing) can be skipped if you do not have these. 
Vegan options: You can substitute paneer with tofu in this recipe. I have made palak tofu many times and the smooth spinach gravy tastes very good with the tofu. You can use cashew or coconut cream in place of regular cream, or just skip the cream altogether.
Restaurant style flavors: I also make a restaurant style palak paneer recipe by smoking the dish using charcoal. This smoking method is also known as dhungar method. I have shown the smoking method in detail in my Dal Makhani recipe.

Instructions
Making Palak Puree
Rinse the palak or spinach leaves very well in running water. Tender stem are fine. If the stems are stringy, then discard the stems.

After 1 minute, using a pasta tong, take the leaves. 
Immediately add the palak or spinach leaves in a pan or bowl containing ice cold water. This method helps in preserving the green color of the spinach. Just add 8 to 10 ice cubes to 3 cups water to get cold water. Allow the spinach leaves to be in the cold water for a minute.
Then drain the ice cold water. Add the spinach in a blender or grinder jar with chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies.
Make a smooth palak puree. No need to add water while making the puree. Keep the spinach puree aside.
Sautéing Onions & Tomatoes
Heat oil or ghee or butter in a pan or kadai. If using butter, melt it a low flame making sure that the butter does not brown.
Add the cumin and let them splutter.
Then add the tej patta or bay leaf.
Add the finely chopped onions. Saute till the onions become golden.
Then add the finely chopped garlic. Saute till the raw aroma of garlic goes away. No need to brown the garlic.
Add the chopped tomatoes. Stir and saute the tomatoes till they soften.
Once the tomatoes are softened and you see fat releasing from the sides of the mixture. Then add the turmeric powder, red chili powder and asafoetida/hing.
Mix very well.


Making Palak Paneer
Then add the palak puree and mix well. 
Add about ½ cup water or as required. Mix again.
Simmer for 6 to 7 minutes or more till the palak or spinach is cooked. Season with salt. The gravy or sauce will also thicken by now.

Stir again and then add the paneer (cottage cheese) cubes.
Mix very well and switch off the heat.
Lastly, add 2 tablespoons of low-fat cream. If using heavy whipping cream, then add 1 tablespoon of it. Stir gently again so that the cream gets incorporated in the gravy uniformly.
Garnishing
Pour the palak paneer in serving bowls. While serving you can top it with some butter or cream.
You can also drizzle a few drops of lime or lemon juice on top along with ginger julienne on the palak paneer.

Stir and serve palak paneer hot with some roti. It also goes very well with Indian breads like tandoori roti, phulka, paratha or naan.
Being a versatile dish, it also accompanies rice dishes from the indian cuisine like cumin rice, vegetable pulao, ghee rice and even a simple steamed rice very well.

Notes
Blanching: I always recommend blanching spinach when making palak paneer recipe. Blanching removes the raw taste, bitterness and metallic flavor of spinach and makes it palatable without having any after taste. Apart from preserving the green color of the spinach leaves, it also gets rid of harmful microorganisms and pesticide residues. 
Pan-frying paneer: The paneer or tofu cubes can also be lightly fried and then added to the spinach sauce. In this case, you don’t need to cook the paneer or tofu in the gravy as when frying they are already cooked.
Spinach: Use fresh tender spinach leaves. Remove the stems before from the leaves if they are dense or stringy. Tender stems can be added. You can also use frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach. 
Paneer: Use fresh paneer or better to use homemade paneer. For packaged paneer or frozen paneer follow the instructions written on the pack.
Optional ingredients: Kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) and asafoetida (hing)can be skipped if you do not have these. 
Vegan variations: Substitute paneer with tofu. Use cashew or coconut cream in place of regular cream, or just skip the cream altogether.

I made this recipe today and it turned out looking like the pictures at each step of the way. Next time I make it I will double all of the spices as I found it too mild. Maybe my spices are too old? It helped me ( a non-Indian cook) a great deal to have all of the ingredients prepared and measured out before starting. I made mine with canola oil and coconut cream instead ghee and cream. I also made my paneer from scratch and next time will use my tofu press to make it more firm and let it press overnight in the fridge. It rather crumbled in the palak. Thank you for sharing this recipe and for the very clear instructions.

thanks memy for the detailed feedback. palak paneer has a mild flavor and taste, but it can be perked up by adding more spices. any neutral tasting oil can be used. coconut cream also works well and give a nice balance in the dish. i am glad that the clear instructions were helpful. thanks again and welcome.
